# XGBoost-Market
This work corresponds to the Final Year Project of Business Administration and Management. It showcases codes developed in R to study the efficacy of XGBoost in a financial context. For this purpose, financial assets such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Bitcoin are examined. This repository also presents csv files and figures in png format to display certain significant results. There are more result graphics than those included in the report. Economic data is analyzed and six implementations have been carried out for each section as described below, in accordance with the prepared report explaining the results.

In Section 5, the initial codes studying the variations in Google's price and its prediction are developed. The models used, unoptimized, can be found in the codes variationprices.R and predictionesprices.R, respectively.

In Section 6, hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation are used to enhance the previous model. This is reflected in hipercrossvalidation.R.

Section 7 presents an analysis of Amazon's economic data through the study of different technical indicators. The model developed in Section 6 is used here. The code corresponding to this part is studyamzn.R.

Finally, Section 8 compares Microsoft and Bitcoin by studying their volatility. This is reflected in microsoftvsbtc.R. In addition, another additional model to study Bitcoin is developed in plusbtc.R.

This work was carried out by Alejandro Magarzo Gonzalo.
